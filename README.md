# ARcoreManas

### Assignment


I tried to play around with the Hello AR example that was given with AR Core. I installed a zombie prefab and used it instead of the andy android prefab. The script that I have modified is the HelloARConrtoller which is attached to the HelloARController gameobject.

I have tried to move the zombie around based on screen tilt and tried to make it jump on double tap. 

The problem is that since I do not have a device that can run the code, I have no idea whether or not this code works or not. It would have been helpful if I had a phone as I could then debug based on the feedback.

Most of what I have done is based on videos that I saw on youtube explaining AR Core.
